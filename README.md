# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## 🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL, and dashboard creation in Power BI.

The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through clear visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset contains structured business data (e.g., sales/customer/transaction data).
- Format: CSV file
- Loaded and processed using Python.
- Stored and queried in PostgreSQL for structured analysis.

## ⚙️ Project Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Inspected data structure and summary statistics
- Checked data types and missing values

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distributions and trends
- Identified patterns and correlations
- Visualized key metrics using charts

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized column formats
- Corrected inconsistent data entries

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
- Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL
- Wrote SQL queries using:
  - SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY
  - JOINs
  - Aggregations
  - Subqueries
- Generated business-level insights

### 5️⃣ Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
- Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL dataset
- Built interactive dashboards
- Designed KPI cards and visual reports
- Enabled filtering and drill-down analysis
